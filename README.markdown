## Cover - Native JavaScript Code Coverage

Cover gives you the ability to collect code-coverage for your projects, using
whatever unit test framework you want, and all using native JavaScript. It also
comes bundled with pre-defined reporters, such as HTML and CLI output, so you
can easily see where you are missing coverage.

### Standing on the shoulders of giants

I would be amiss to not mention that the hard work in this library was
by [Chris Dickinson] with his work on [runforcover]. In reality, Cover is 
a fork of runforcover, fixing some of the issues and making it more usable.

The original version of Cover used [substack]'s excellent [bunker] library,
but it has recently been moved to using [esprima] and a new code homegrown
instrumentation library.

### Known Issues

There are currently a few known issues that I am working on:

1. If you use 'global' to pass state between modules (mocha does this, for
example), then you might run into issues. Cover runs modules as if they
were executed with `NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS` was set.

2. If you start new node processes, Cover won't work with those, as
it instruments by hooking into `require`.

### Usage

Using Cover is simple. Simply install it globally:

> npm install cover -g

And then, run it

> cover run mytests.js

Want to pass some arguments to your test? No problem (note the `--`):

> cover run mytests.js -- --arg1 --arg2=foo

 Once you've run your tests, it will create a directory with coverage data in it.
 If you want to see the coverage report, simply run:
 
 > cover report
 
 which will output the report to the CLI. Want to get an HTML report?
 
 > cover report html
 
 This will create a `cover_html` directory with the coverage information.
 
### Configuration

Cover reads from a `.coverrc` file in your project directory, and it comes
with sensible defaults. Here are the defaults that it uses:

    {
        "formatter": "cli",
        "ignore": ".coverignore",
        
        "prefix": "coveragefile_",              // Prefix for coverage data files
        "dataDirectory": ".coverage_data",      // Directory to put coverage files in
        
        "debugDirectory": ".coverage_debug",    // Directory to put instrumented files in
        
        "modules": false,                       // Whether or not to cover node_modules directory
        
        // Formatter-specific info
        "html" : {
            "directory": "cover_html",          // Directory to write HTML files too
            "generateIndex": true               // Whether to generate an index.html file
        },
        
        "json": {
        }
    }
    
You can also specify which files to ignore using .coverignore. Here is the one used
for Cover itself:

    node_modules
    
You can specify both files and directories in the `.coverignore` file.

If you have a customer path for your configuration files, you can specify this
on the command line:

> cover --config path/to/config --ignore path/to/ignore run myfile.js
